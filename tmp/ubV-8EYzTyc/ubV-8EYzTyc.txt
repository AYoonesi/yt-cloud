i have three books that i want to share  with you they are relatively inexpensive  and they will take you from a beginner  at python a novice not knowing anything  about it at all  to  a sort of intermediate python programmer  that really understands the foundations  and can work on your own projects they  are relatively inexpensive especially  compared to a lot of the other courses  out there and well you know if you like  books they're ideal and they're very  well respected books and they have good  reviews so let's take a look at them now  so here are the three books this is them  and i'm going to take you through one by  one the first book and this is a book  for absolute beginners in python and  it's probably no surprise it's python  crash course this is  really  one of the best introductory books on  python that you will find i mean it  depends  a little on what you're looking for if  you want more sort of computer science  there are other books that i would  recommend but if you're just starting  from scratch and you want to get going  in python  this is an excellent book why do i like  it i like it because it's a nice mix of  teaching you the basics the fundamentals  of python and then giving you experience  on working with projects that's the way  the book's laid out teaches you about  lists about dictionaries about strings  it gives you the fundamentals that you  need to know to be able then to work on  the projects and there are some  interesting projects one of the projects  is creating a small game the other is a  data visualization project and the third  and final project is a web app and once  you finish going through this book and  you must go through it all go through  all the chapters go through all the code  snippets until you really understand it  and work through the projects once you  get to the end of it you will have a  good beginner knowledge of python if you  want to dig a bit deeper  then i would recommend this book so this  is a python reference now i've reviewed  this on the channel before fairly  recently  this is by david beasley who is a real  python expert  you learn by doing  and that's why i think today's sponsor  brilliant is a great choice for anybody  that wants to learn programming  brilliant is an interactive online  learning platform that focuses on  teaching stem topics interactively and  it's that interactivity that really  helps you to learn every topic that  brilliant covers is followed by an  interactive puzzle that you have to  solve before moving on the puzzles are  designed to ensure that solving them  really enhances your understanding of  the topic brilliant covers an enormous  range of different subjects like  computer science and maths and physics  and you can learn a huge amount just  using it for 10 minutes a day that tends  to be how i use it if there's a topic  i'm feeling a bit rusty on or something  i haven't covered before i can go onto  the brilliant app and get learning  straight away it's so much more engaging  and fun solving interactive puzzles than  just reading about topics there's a link  in the description you can start for  free and the first 200 people to sign up  will get 20 off brilliant annual premium  subscription and this digs a little  deeper into a lot of the topics that  this book will cover so if you want to  understand things at a slightly deeper  level as you work through the other book  then you can use this as a reference so  these two together work quite well this  gives you a nice broad introduction to  the foundations that you need to know  this one goes a little deeper and  explains really well the sort of concept  behind what you're doing  okay but one of the questions i get  asked a lot is okay i finished an  introductory book or an introductory  course on python but what do i do now  i'm kind of stuck i don't know enough to  work on my own project and sort of take  my programming further that way  i'm not enrolled in a class i don't have  classmates or teachers that can help me  because i'm learning on my own so what  do i do and in that case you need to  work through your own projects  and there are various different ways of  doing that and there are a lot of good  resources online and available in books  to do that  one of my favorites  is this one  it's in practical python projects and i  also have a review of this so there's a  review of these two books in the  description i do have a review of python  crash course but it was some time ago  and i think it was a different edition  but i will leave links to the full  reviews and summaries of these books  in the description  but this will take the knowledge that  you've gleaned from working through  these two books or working through this  and using this as a reference um  and it will enable you to build things  with that knowledge that you have and  work on projects and so  taken together the python crash course  python distilled and then this  will really get you to a point where you  can feel confident to work on your own  projects and incidentally this book will  last you you know all  throughout your python career  start with this  use this as a reference  and then work through the projects in  here by the time you finished i  guarantee you'll have a really good  understanding of python
